# Assignment 1 IMAD5112

## Overview
**Assignment 1 IMAD5112** is a mobile application developed as part of the IMAD5112 module. The application serves as a practical demonstration of key mobile development concepts, incorporating design best practices, version control with GitHub, and automation using GitHub Actions.

## Purpose of the App
The app is designed to provide food suggestions based on the user's input of the time of day. By entering a specific period (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, Dinner), the app returns an appropriate meal recommendation. The app enhances user experience with a simple and intuitive UI while ensuring accurate input handling and validation.

## Design Considerations
The design of the app was influenced by several key considerations:
- **User Experience (UX)**: The interface is minimalistic and user-friendly to ensure seamless interaction.
- **Responsiveness**: The app layout is structured using ConstraintLayout to provide adaptability across different screen sizes.
- **Error Handling**: Input validation is implemented to ensure only valid time periods are accepted.
- **Code Efficiency**: The logic for food suggestions is mapped in a structured way using a HashMap.

## Utilization of GitHub & GitHub Actions
### GitHub Repository Management
The project is managed using GitHub for version control. Key aspects include:
- **Commit History**: Regular commits are made to track progress and changes.
- **Branching Strategy**: Separate branches are used for feature development and bug fixes.
- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub Issues are used to document bugs and feature enhancements.

### GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is integrated into the project for CI/CD automation, including:
- **Automated Testing**: Runs unit tests on each commit to maintain code quality.
- **Build Verification**: Ensures the app builds successfully before merging changes.
- **Code Linting**: Ensures adherence to coding standards.
